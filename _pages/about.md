Welcome! I’m Diego Villalba, a BSc student in Physics at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico). I have a deep passion for astrophysics, computational physics, and machine learning, with a current focus on expanding my knowledge and skills in analyzing N-body cosmological simulations.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to participate in various research projects, attend specialized workshops, and engage with student organizations. These experiences have fueled my curiosity about how machine learning can enhance computational analysis of observational data in fields such as cosmology, astrophysical observation, and even biomedical healthcare.

## Research Interests:
- M.L. Super Resolution of Cosmological Simulations 
- N-Body simulaitons
- Paralel procesing of computational data


## Personal
I am from Mexico City and in addition to my studies, I enjoy tutoring new students, lab work, astrophotography, participate in student organizatons and volunteering in science comunication proyects, as I believe that learning goes beyond the classroom. I’m always excited to connect with others who share my interests and to explore new ideas and perspectives.

Feel free to check out my projects, coursework, blog posts, portfolios, or extracurricular activities. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to chat or collaborate—I’m always open to learning from others and exploring new opportunities!
