**Welcome! I’m Diego Villalba**, a BSc student in Physics at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico), currently specializing in **cosmology, computational astrophysics, and machine learning**.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of **large-scale structure formation**, **N-body cosmological simulations**, and **modern ML techniques**. My current focus is on exploring how differentiable models, neural implicit representations, and simulation-based inference can improve the analysis and reconstruction of cosmological fields.

In addition to cosmology, I work on **machine learning–based super-resolution**, both in:
- **Cosmology** — super-resolving N-body simulations, displacement fields, and cosmological structures,  
- **Medical imaging** — as a side project focused on **MRI acceleration**, leveraging neural reconstruction techniques to reduce acquisition time while preserving diagnostic quality.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work as a **research student at the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)** in San Sebastián, Spain, under the supervision of **Dr. Raúl Angulo** and **Dr. Carolina Cuesta-Lázaro**. There, I worked on projects involving **compressed representations of cosmological simulations**, displacement-field reconstruction, and ML-driven approaches to high-resolution structure formation. This experience strengthened my interest in computational cosmology and gave me hands-on exposure to cutting-edge research using **high-performance computing**, **PyTorch-based ML models**, and **next-generation simulation tools**.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve taken part in multiple research projects, attended specialized workshops, and collaborated in student-led scientific initiatives. These experiences have deepened my curiosity about how machine learning can transform computational modeling across domains — from cosmology and astrophysical data analysis to biomedical imaging.

## Personal

I’m originally from Mexico City. Outside of research, I enjoy tutoring new physics students, working in teaching labs, astrophotography, and participating in student organizations and science-communication activities. I strongly believe in making science accessible and building a collaborative academic environment.

I’m always excited to connect with people who share interests in **cosmology, ML, scientific computing, or data-driven science**, so feel free to reach out!
