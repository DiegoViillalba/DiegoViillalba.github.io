**Welcome! I’m Diego Villalba**, a BSc student in Physics at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico), currently specializing in **cosmology, computational astrophysics, and machine learning**.

I am deeply interested in the intersection of **machine learning and cosmology**, particularly in how modern ML methods can enhance the analysis and reconstruction of cosmological simulations. Currently, during my research stay at the **Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)**, I am expanding this line of work by studying how **differentiable models, neural implicit representations, and simulation-based inference** can be used to analyze, compress, and reconstruct cosmological fields with higher precision and physical fidelity.  At UNAM, I worked on **ML-based super-resolution of cosmological fields**, exploring techniques to upscale and recover high-resolution structure from coarse N-body data.

In addition to cosmology, I work on **machine learning–based solutions**, both in:
- **Medical imaging** — as a side project focused on **MRI acceleration**, leveraging neural reconstruction techniques to reduce acquisition time while preserving diagnostic quality.
- **Industry** — working on implementations of OCR methods applied to industry pipelines 

Recently, I had the opportunity to work as a **research student at the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)** in San Sebastián, Spain, under the supervision of **Dr. Raúl Angulo** and **Dr. Carolina Cuesta-Lázaro**. There, I worked on projects involving **compressed representations of cosmological simulations**, displacement-field reconstruction, and ML-driven approaches to high-resolution structure formation. This experience strengthened my interest in computational cosmology and gave me hands-on exposure to cutting-edge research using **high-performance computing**, **PyTorch-based ML models**, and **next-generation simulation tools**.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve taken part in multiple research projects, attended specialized workshops, and collaborated in student-led scientific initiatives. These experiences have deepened my curiosity about how machine learning can transform computational modeling across domains — from cosmology and astrophysical data analysis to biomedical imaging.

## Personal

I’m originally from Mexico City. Outside of research, I enjoy tutoring new physics students, working in teaching labs, astrophotography, and participating in student organizations and science-communication activities. I strongly believe in making science accessible and building a collaborative academic environment.

I’m always excited to connect with people who share interests in **cosmology, ML, scientific computing, or data-driven science**, so feel free to reach out!
