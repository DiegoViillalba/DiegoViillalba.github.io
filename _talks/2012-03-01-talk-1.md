Noche de las Estrellas was an incredible public event dedicated to astronomy and science outreach, where we brought the wonders of the cosmos closer to the community. As the main coordinator of this activity, I oversaw the organization and execution of the event, ensuring a seamless and enriching experience for all attendees.

During the event, we set up multiple telescopes for both daytime and nighttime observations, allowing participants to explore celestial objects such as the Moon, planets, and deep-sky phenomena. The event featured engaging discussions, hands-on activities, and an inspiring environment that encouraged curiosity and learning.

With a remarkable turnout of 700 people, the event successfully connected the public with astronomy enthusiasts, students, and professionals. Through guided observations and interactive sessions, attendees had the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the universe and appreciate the beauty of the night sky.

The experience was not only about observing celestial bodies but also about fostering a sense of wonder, discovery, and scientific curiosity in an inclusive and dynamic setting. Noche de las Estrellas was a truly memorable night where the passion for astronomy illuminated the minds of many.
