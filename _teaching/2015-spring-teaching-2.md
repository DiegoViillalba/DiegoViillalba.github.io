As part of the Propedutic Courses at the Faculty of Sciences, I had the opportunity to teach Analytical Geometry, a fundamental subject aimed at helping incoming students bridge the gap between high school and university-level mathematics. These preparatory courses were designed to provide students with a solid foundation in key mathematical concepts, ensuring they could confidently tackle the rigorous coursework of their first semester.

The Analytical Geometry course covered essential topics such as coordinate systems, conic sections, vector spaces, and transformations, all of which are crucial for students pursuing degrees in physics, mathematics, and related sciences. Through a combination of theory, problem-solving exercises, and interactive discussions, I helped students develop their mathematical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and confidence before officially starting their university journey.

These propedutic courses played a vital role in easing the transition for new students, providing them with the necessary tools to succeed in their academic careers. By offering personalized guidance and fostering a supportive learning environment, we ensured that students could start their semester with a strong mathematical foundation and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
